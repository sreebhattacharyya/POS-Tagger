# POS-Tagger

This is the code I wrote to learn building a basic POS Tagger using Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi Algorithm.

The dataset used is a subset of the WSJ Corpus for POS Tagging. The whole experiment, data subset is obtained from and guided by the assignment from [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp) Coursera course. However, the code is NOT my original assignment file.
